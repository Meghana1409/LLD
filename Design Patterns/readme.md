Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

Classification of patterns:
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed.
The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.
The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.
Three main groups of patterns:

Creational patterns : 
-provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
-These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Structural patterns : 
-explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
-These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Behavioral patterns : 
-take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
-These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

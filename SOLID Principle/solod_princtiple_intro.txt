SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles that can help you write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code based on well-designed, cleanly structured classes.
SOLID is an acronym that groups five core principles that apply to object-oriented design. These principles are the following:

Single-responsibility principle (SRP)
Openâ€“closed principle (OCP)
Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
Interface segregation principle (ISP)
Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
